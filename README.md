# Chatbot

Project Title: AI-Based Chatbot using Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow

Description for Re:
Developed an intelligent chatbot application using Python, integrated with Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for natural language processing and TensorFlow for training a deep learning model.
The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries and responding appropriately based on intent classification.

Key Features:

Preprocessed and tokenized text data using NLTK (lemmatization, stop-word removal, etc.).
Built a neural network model with TensorFlow for intent recognition and response generation.
Trained the model on a custom dataset of intents and conversational patterns.
Implemented a user-friendly command-line interface for real-time user interaction.
Applied bag-of-words model and one-hot encoding for input representation.

Technologies Used:
Python, NLTK, TensorFlow, NumPy, JSON.

Outcome:

Successfully created a rule-based and ML-enhanced chatbot capable of answering FAQs, with potential for extension into web or messaging platforms.

This project showcases a foundational understanding of NLP, deep learning, and AI-based conversational systems.
